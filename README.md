# WinnipegElectionResults

## Under Construction!
I conceived and designed this app for my final project in the Udacity iOS Developer course. <br>
It is an attempt at making information about Winnipeg's municipal elections very accessible to the public, removing the need to dig through a government website and to put the data in a spreadsheet yourself. <br>

### Current features:
<li>Records of every general and by-election going back to [insert year here].</li>
<li>Pie charts for final election results by ward</li>
<li>The ability to save an election result for easy viewing later on.

### Future features:
<li>A Councillor/School trustee detailed description view.</li>

## Project Dependencies
All dependencies are installed with cocoapods and contained in the podfile. <br>
*Alamofire*: For web requests {?}. <br>
*Kanna*: For parsing html {?}. <br>
*Charts*: For presenting scraped data. <br>

If you are attempting to build this in Xcode, build it from the WinnipegElectionResults.xworkspace file.
